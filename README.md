# Covid-19 Statistics: Cases, Deaths, & Vaccinations (as of July 23, 2021)
This is a project tabulating Covid-19 pandemic data from the start of the pandemic (around March 2020) up until July 23, 2021. I used SQL to modify the dataset and Tableau to visualize the data.

## Datasets
The original data set is taken from the website "Our World in Data". It is updated daily. However, for the sake of this project, the data is displayed only up to July 23, 2021.

The datasets attached in the repository is an Excel-modified dataset from the website. I broke it down into CovidVaccinations.CSV and CovidDeaths.CSV

## SQL File
The analysis, cleaning, and modification of this data is done in SQL. CovidProject file contains the SQL code for this project.

## Data Visualization
After I have finished analyzing the data in SQL, I took some of the SQL-analyzed results and put it into Tableau. Tableau Table 1.CSV to Tableau Table 4.CSV are the files that I created from SQL for the purpose of data visualization in Tableau.
